    "# **Intro: Why Python?**\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is one of the most popular programming languages today. Below is a simple and clear explanation of its strengths and shortcomings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Advantages of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. High-Level Language**\n",
    "Python is a **high-level programming language**, meaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is very **close to human language**\n",
    "- Its syntax is simple, readable, and easy to understand\n",
    "- You don’t manage memory, CPU registers, or hardware directly\n",
    "- You can focus on solving the problem instead of technical details\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it is so high-level, Python allows you to write code **fast**, with fewer bugs, and with much less complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**But:**\n",
    "Being high-level usually means the language is **slower**, because many low-level operations are handled automatically behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**High-Level ➜ Easy to read, slower execution**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Low-Level ➜ Hard to write, very fast execution**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### **2. Huge Library Ecosystem**\n",
    "Python has a massive collection of **libraries and frameworks** for almost every domain:\n",
    "- Data science (NumPy, pandas)\n",
    "- Machine learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch)\n",
    "- Web development (Django, Flask)\n",
    "- Automation and scripting\n",
    "- Scientific computing and engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "These libraries make it extremely powerful and flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Free and Open Source**\n",
    "Python is completely **free to use**, open source, and supported by a large global community that constantly improves and expands the ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ❗ Shortcomings of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Slow Performance**\n",
    "Python is slower than compiled languages like C, C++, or Java because it is interpreted.\n",
    "It prioritizes readability and simplicity over execution speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Runtime Speed Video](https://x.com/i/status/1861072804239847914)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Not Ideal for Mobile Development**\n",
    "Python is rarely used for mobile app development.\n",
    "iOS and Android do not support Python natively, so mobile performance is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. High Memory Usage**\n",
    "Python programs often consume more memory compared to lower-level languages, making it less suitable for:\n",
    "- Embedded systems\n",
    "- Memory-limited devices\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**\n",
    "Python’s GIL allows only **one thread to execute Python code at a time**, limiting true parallelism in CPU-heavy tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Not Suitable for Real-Time Systems**\n",
    "Python is not ideal for real-time, low-latency applications like high-frequency trading or hardware control due to interpreter overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Runtime Type Errors**\n",
    "Because Python is dynamically typed, type-related bugs appear **during runtime**, not before.\n",
    "This can cause unexpected crashes in production if not carefully tested."

    "### **What is Python Code?**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write a program in **Python**, you are writing human-readable instructions (called **source code**). Unlike some other languages, Python is an **interpreted** language, which means your computer doesn't translate the entire program into machine language all at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Two-Step**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python runs your code in a quick, two-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Compilation to Bytecode**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you execute a Python file (e.g., `my_script.py`), the first thing the **Python Interpreter** does is compile your source code into an intermediate form called **bytecode**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What is Bytecode?** Think of bytecode as a series of instructions that are **easier for a computer to understand** but are still **not** the raw binary machine code.\n",
    "* **Where does it go?** Python often saves this bytecode in files ending with the extension **`.pyc`** (Python compiled). This step is done so quickly, you often don't even notice it!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Execution by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step is the actual running of the program. The bytecode is fed, line by line, to the **Python Virtual Machine (PVM)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What is the PVM?** The PVM is a piece of software that acts as a runtime engine. It takes the bytecode instructions and translates them **on the fly** into the actual machine code that your computer's CPU can execute.\n",
    "* **Why a Virtual Machine?** This layer of abstraction (the PVM) is why Python is considered **cross-platform**. The same bytecode can run on a Windows PVM, a Mac PVM, or a Linux PVM. You write the code once, and the PVM handles the specifics of the operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaway**\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, when you press \"Run\" in your Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Python **compiles** your code into **bytecode**.\n",
    "2.  The **Python Virtual Machine (PVM)** **executes** that bytecode, making your program run!\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is what makes Python so **flexible and easy to use**—you don't have to worry about the complex machine language; Python handles all that translation for you."

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Sequential Execution (Top-to-Bottom)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most fundamental rule of how the **Python Interpreter** reads your code is simple: **it executes code sequentially, from the top line down to the bottom line.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simple Flow:** When you run a script, the Interpreter starts at the first line and completes that instruction before moving to the second, and so on.\n",
    "* **Deviation:** This linear flow only changes when the Interpreter encounters control structures like **`if` statements**, **`for` loops**, or **function calls**, which tell it to skip lines or repeat a block of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Basic Syntax Rules**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax** is the set of rules that defines how a Python program must be written. Think of it as the grammar of the language. If you break these rules, the Interpreter will stop and give you a **SyntaxError**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **PEP8**:\n",
    "Python has a style guide called **PEP8** that outlines best practices for writing clean and readable code. While not enforced by the **Interpreter**, following PEP8 helps maintain consistency across Python codebases.\n",
    "#### **Comment**:\n",
    "Anything following a `#` symbol on a line is considered a comment and is ignored by the Interpreter. Use comments to explain your code.\n",
    "#### **Indentation**:\n",
    "Python uses indentation (spaces or tabs at the beginning of a line) to define blocks of code. Consistent indentation is crucial; mixing tabs and spaces can lead to errors."

    "The `print()` function is the most fundamental tool in Python for displaying output. It sends data to the **standard output device** (usually your console or screen).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Standard Behavior:** By default, it prints the items you pass to it, separated by spaces, and adds a newline character at the end.\n",

    "\n",
    "Default: The default value is a single space (`' '`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Customization: You can change this to a comma, a hyphen, a newline (`\\n`), or any other string.\n",

    "### **3. Arguments: `end` (End Character)**\n",
    "The `end` argument controls what is printed after the last item.\n",

    "Default: The default value is a newline character (`\\n`), which moves the cursor to the next line.\n",
