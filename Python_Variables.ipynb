    "\n",
    "### **1. Concept: Containers for Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is essentially a **label** or a **name** given to a specific location in the computer's memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Storage:** Instead of remembering complex memory addresses, you use a simple name (like `score` or `price`) to store and retrieve data.\n",
    "* **Analogy:** Think of a variable as a box. You put an object (data) inside and write a name on the outside of the box so you can find it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. The Assignment Operator (=)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `=` symbol in Python is **not** \"equals\" like in math class. It is the **assignment operator**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Direction:** It works from **Right to Left**.\n",
    "* **Action:** It calculates the value on the right side and assigns it to the variable name on the left side."

    "## **Variables: Declaring and Using**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Declaration (Initialization)**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, \"declaring\" a variable happens automatically the moment you assign a value to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **No Setup Needed:** You do not need to tell Python \"I am making an integer\" beforehand (unlike C++ or Java).\n",
    "* **Syntax:** simply type `name = value`.\n",
    "* **Three properties:**\n",
    "  - **Name:** The variable's name (e.g., `age`, `total`, `username`).\n",
    "  - **Value:** The data you want to store (e.g., `25`, `99.99`, `\"Alice\"`).\n",
    "  - **Type:** The kind of data (e.g., Integer, Float, String, Boolean) which Python infers automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Using Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a variable is created, you can use its name anywhere you would normally use a value. If you didn't **create it first**, Python will give you an **error**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **In Print:** Pass the variable name to `print()`.\n",
    "* **In Math:** Add, subtract, or multiply variables together.\n",
    "* **In Strings:** Concatenate (join) variables with text."

    "\n",
    "These are rules for writing \"clean\" Python code (PEP 8 style).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **snake_case:** Use all lowercase letters and separate words with underscores (e.g., `my_variable`, `user_data`).\n",
    "* **CamelCase:** Less common in Python, but sometimes used (e.g., `myVariable`, `userData`).\n",
    "* **Descriptive:** Choose names that explain the value (`age` is better than `a`).\n",
