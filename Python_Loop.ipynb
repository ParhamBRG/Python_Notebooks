    "\n",
    "### `break` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `break` statement is used to terminate a loop prematurely. When the `break` statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately terminated, and the program continues with the next statement after the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of the break statement\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",

    "### `continue` Statement\n",
