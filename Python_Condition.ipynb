    "## Introduction\n",
    "In Python, conditions are fundamental for creating dynamic and responsive programs. They are implemented using `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements. This tutorial will guide you through the basics of conditions and their applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Conditions in Python?\n",
    "Conditions are crucial in programming for various reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Control Flow:** Conditions enable the control flow of a program, determining which statements get executed and which are skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decision Making:** Conditions allow the program to make decisions based on the current state or input, providing flexibility and adaptability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling Different Cases:** They are used to handle different cases or scenarios, making the program more robust and versatile."

    "## 1. The `if` Statement\n",
    "The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition evaluates to `True`. The basic syntax is as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # Code to be executed if the condition is True\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, condition is an expression that is evaluated. If it is True, the indented code block underneath it will be executed."
